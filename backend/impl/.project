	<comment>Eve&apos;s backend subsystem contains several components to manage schema objects. One of those components is a OID to Syntax registry for all schema syntaxes. The registry is responsible for adding new syntaxes by OID as well as enabling the lookup of Syntaxs based on OID. This project contains the SyntaxRegistry implementation used at server startup rather than the solid state syntax registry. The reason for the separate services is to reduce cyclic dependency. The bootstrap implementation unlike the solid state implementation does not depend on the system backend to store syntax information. So this version of the component allows the system backend which depends on schema information to startup without having a cyclic dependency.</comment>
