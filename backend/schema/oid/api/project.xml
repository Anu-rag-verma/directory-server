    <description>
        Eve's backend subsystem contains several components to manage schema
        objects.  One of those components is a name to OID registry for all
        schema entities.  The registry is responsible for adding new names
        to an OID as well as enabling the lookup of primary and auxillary 
        names for schema objects with IANA assigned OID numbers.
