The service interface is the SyntaxRegistry.  This component implements
this service interface. 
        </p>
        <p>
The Merlin component is a wrapper around the BootstrapSyntaxRegistry
that implements the SyntaxRegistry interface and uses the Avalon lifecycles
to initialize the BootstrapSyntaxRegistry instance it contains.  The OidRegistry
is a service interface which both the POJO and the Merlin component depends
on.  The component dependencies are illustrated in the component diagram.
        </p>
        <p>
The bootstrap component does not implement the registration methods because
it is static.  It reads the XML configuration file from which it extracts
the required set of Syntaxes to operate.  The POJO implementation or delegate
as we call it throws a UnsupportedOperation exception which is a form of 
NamingException.
