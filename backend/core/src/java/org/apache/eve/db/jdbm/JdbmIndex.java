 *
 *      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 *      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 *      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
 *      and conversions to other media types.
 *
 *      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 *      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 *      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 *      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 *
 *      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 *      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

 *      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 *
 *      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
 *      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 *      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 *      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 *      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

 *
 *      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 *      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

 *
 *   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 *      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 *      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 *
 *   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 *      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 *      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 *      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 *      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 *      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 *      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 *      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 *      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *      as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *      meet the following conditions:
 *
 *      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 *          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 *
 *      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 *          stating that You changed the files; and
 *
 *      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 *          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *          the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *          as modifying the License.
 *
 *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *      the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
