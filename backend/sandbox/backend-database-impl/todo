* When there is one level scope and dereferencing in search is enabled
  it might be worth while to just take a scan count on the oneAliasIdx.
  A scan count using the baseId will return the number of scope 
  extending aliases.  The ids of the target entries for these aliases
  can be found (dereferenced) and then they could be 
  
* Expand on the scope node to accommodate the alias functionality.


* Scope expanding aliases can be listed for a base.
	- For one level scope with dereferencing in search, a scope enumeration
	  returns all the child entries of the base.  If an alias is 
	  encountered then a lookup is performed on the to determine if the aliases
	
	- For subtree scope the alias' target is added to a disjunction with the base
