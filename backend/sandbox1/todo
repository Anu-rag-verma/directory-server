* Get the following schema managers working:
	BootstrapAttributeTypeManager,
	BootstrapObjectClassManager
* Add following signature to all managers:
	NamingEnumeration list() ;
* Change block configuration for SystemBackend using the 
  BootstrapAttributeTypeManager
* Configure specialized indices based on the new architecture.  These indices
  may be easily put together using the builders.  We may not need to define
  separate AttributeType definitions for them.  We may even be able to add 
  these attributeType specs to the bootstrap specifications: may have to add a
  builtin function or two with a helper class etc.

When finished review to make sure the correct dependencies are used for all prjs
Make sure the contents of the project.xml are accurate

Refactor modifyRdn() to rename() and other interface methods that may not seem
generalized.
