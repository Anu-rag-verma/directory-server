<para>Schema data will be available to the DefaultBackend but it will not be available to the SystemBackend. 
We want separate configuration pathways to enable these backends and their databases.</para>
<para/>
<para>Databases can expose interfaces for configuration by the backend which itself is configurable. 
A common database configuration section can contain index sections. 
These sections can optionally provide index attribute specifications. 
If the attribute specification is not present with the index it is presumed to be available through the schema manager and so index initialization is delayed until a later phase when the handles to the schema manager have been established. 
So the specs and hence the indices depending on them are initialized either by the SchemaManager or by the configuration of the backend.</para>
