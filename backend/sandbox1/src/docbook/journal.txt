Just for the heck of it I want to ramble about what I have to do in the next
few days.

1). Begin working on the interceptor framework and the interceptor injected
    services.  Lets get the framework up and start creating a pipline of mock
    services.

2). Start thinking about the new SystemBackend implementation using JDBM as 
    a schema less backend.  Remember all features of a backend need not be 
    supported here.  I think we are going to need to create divergent JDBM
    backends but we can agree on a set of JDBM base classes.
    
3). Some things that come to mind:

	- Keep in mind module dependencies and how they are to be worked out
	- We no longer use the Module interface with all those life-cycle methods
	  bundled together.
    - Note that we have to conduct searches even if we must do a full table 
      scan.  However we can provide some nice options for JDBM to handle bad
      search filters - like index referrals in the index mesh.
	- Might provide a simple normalization service for backends based on a 
	  schema.

4). Today is August 7th say.  By October 16th (LDAPd's first birthday) I intend
    to have the new backend apparatus complete minus the services that do not
    even exist today.  By Oct. 16th LDAPd should be retrofitted with this new 
    design/architecture which is code named Eve.  We shall release ldapd-0.75a
    on Oct. 16th.  That gives me 2 months and a week to get this release out.
    
    Here are some milestones I want to shoot for:
    
    -> Aug 14th Complete the Interceptor Framework
    	- Use the framework to build out skeletal services to expand on later
    	- Add operational attribute service
    -> Aug 28th Complete the system backend
    
    Hope to finish this by the end of the 22nd
    
    -> Sept 7th Complete Schema Manager
    	- Complete the study of how schema data is used
    	- Design minimal schema DIT or catalog under ou=system,ou=schema
    	- Build out the schema manager and schema interfaces
    	- Add fully operational schema checking service
    	- Add fully operational normalization service
   
   I will abandon this for now.  Let's reuse the existing SchemaManager w/
   slight modifications.  Cuts time down to the 24th of Aug or so.	
    	
    -> Sept 21st Complete modjdbm Default Backend Redesign
    	- Add filter pruning interceptor service
    	- Add filter augmentation interceptor service for generalized attribute
    	  searches.
    	- Fully integrate with JNDI provider
    	
   This I think can be done by the first week of Sept.
    	
    -> Oct 3rd Bring Eve Up W/ Protocol Server To Present Day State of 0.7a
    
   Can be done by mid september
    
    -> Oct 16th Smooth Out and Polish for B-day Release of Eve

   Be done by Oct start maybe - give time for good release

Some sore points:

1). Implementation specific operational attributes need to be properly handled
    in the right place.  Right now we confuse attribute names and index names
    et cetera.
    
2). Are we going to implement any more system indices like a updn to ndn mapping
    and what about aliases indices.
    
3). Do we really need to keep the numsubordinates operational attribute - what
	does it buy us?

4). If we will use the numsubordinates operational attribute should we build a
	table mapping ids to the number of subordinates instead.
