      <p>
        At the present moment, the performance benefits of SEDA are at the
        top of the list.  Other features which make SEDA based servers more
        instrumentable, resilient and extensible are not sought after at the
        present moment.  Under heavy load we would like the server to perform 
        well without rapid degradation while servicing requests.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Furthermore we want to add these features without incurring more 
        complexity in the server's design.  Keeping things as simple as possible
        is a driving factor in our approach simple SEDA implementation.  Hence
        to simple SEDA stage is simply a combination of a event queue, thread 
        pool, stage handler, and a driver thread.  The one extra feature we do
        support is the EnquePredicates which might be used to manage load 
        shedding.

        The simple SEDA code can be found the common frontend API within the
        <a href="">org.apache.eve.seda</a> package.
