                                  TODO List
                                  ---------

* Start writing some documentation for this subproject using xdocs.

* Add the rest of the description generation functions in DescriptionUtil.

* Correct any javadoc inconsistances or errors in the DescriptionUtil.

* Writes some test cases to validate correct syntax description generation.

* Determine if we should create a SubschemaSubentry interface and impl here.

* Determine if we should create parsers for these various types here in this
  project within a separate package.  Likewise should we store xml based 
  factories for these objects here as well.

* If parsers and other factories are created then we need to write some test
  cases for them.

* Finish off the POM so it is correct and up to date double checking to make
  sure all dependencies are all still required.

* Make sure we pass using our own check style settings.
