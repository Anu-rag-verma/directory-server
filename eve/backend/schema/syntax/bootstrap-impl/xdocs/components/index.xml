        <p>
          This component diagram shows the dependencies between simple
          implementations and the Merlin wrappers.  All dependencies as
          expected are based on the service interfaces exposed.  For
          simplicity the implemented service interface has been replicated
          rather than sharing the interface between multiple components:
          there is only one interface object however.
