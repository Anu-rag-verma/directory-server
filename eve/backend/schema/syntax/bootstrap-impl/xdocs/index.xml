  <section name="About the Bootstrap Syntax Registry">
    <p>
Welcome! This page describes the Bootstrap Syntax Registry, a component within 
Eve's backend under the schema subsystem.
    </p>
    <p>
Eve must be able to resolve schema syntax definitions based either on name or 
OID.  The SyntaxRegistry service interface provides for easy lookup and
registration of schema syntaxes.
    </p>
    <p>
This componenet is a special form of SyntaxRegistry only used during the
initialization of the server.  There is yet another SyntaxRegistry used during 
the solid state of operation.  This is the default SyntaxRegistry and it 
depends on the system backend as its backing store for Syntax data.  During
server startup the system backend is unavailable yet certain syntaxes are
still required by the server to initialize the system backend in the first
place.
    </p>
    <p>
Rather than have a cycle of dependency between the system backend and a 
SyntaxRegisrty we opted to create two totally different implementations.
This implementation simply reads configuration information from an XML
file which is used as its read only Syntax backing store.  After its use
is fulfilled during startup the compoenent is never used again and can
be decomissioned.
