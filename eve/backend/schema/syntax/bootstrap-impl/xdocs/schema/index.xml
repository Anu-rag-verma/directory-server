           Syntaxes for the bootstrap syntax registry are defined here within
           the configuration for the component.
         </p>
         <p>
           Several syntaxes each with its own SyntaxChecker can be defined.
           The registry cannot add to the definitions provided here and hence
           is static.  Calls to the register methods of the SyntaxRegistry 
           interfaces for this component generate exceptions indicating that
           the operation is not supported.
         </p>
         <p>
           Note that only those syntaxes absolutely required for the server 
           to initialize are required here.  The solid state implementation
           of the SyntaxRegistry should be used for dynamic Syntax additions
           to the server after it has started up.
