Changes since 0.8
=================

 o added Preferences implementation for system settings (user Prefs not done)
 o added support for JNDI state factories and object factories
 o added schema support for object and state factories - plugin is prep'd for
   generating these from schema definitions and domain models: code to do this
   just needs to be added.
 o added factory.hints property to help drive the selection of a object
   factory when there are multiple alternatives
