  Unfortunately the Basic User's Guide for ApacheDS 1.5 is not finished yet. We have started to move and revise the content, things
  you find here are work in progress but should be valid for ApacheDS 1.5.5. In the meantime you can have a look at
  the ApacheDS 1.0 Basic User's Guide, which is currently more complete.
