  <title>Basic User's Guide</title>
  <important>
    Work in progress
    Unfortunately the Basic User's Guide for ApacheDS 1.5 is not finished yet. We have started to move
    and revise the content, things
    you find here are work in progress but should be valid for ApacheDS 1.5.5. In the
    meantime you can have a look at
    the
    <link
      xlink:href="http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/1.0/apacheds-v10-basic-users-guide.html">ApacheDS 1.0 Basic User's Guide</link>
    , which is currently more complete.

    <title>Audience</title>
    <para>This guide is primarily for people new to ApacheDS. If you plan to use the server as is, maybe even for your
      first LDAP experience, you'll (hopefully) find all information necessary to do so. Only basic configuration tasks
      are covered. Learn more about the options you have (and many other things) in the ApacheDS v1.5 Advanced User's
      Guide.</para>
