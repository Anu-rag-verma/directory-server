        The frontend is composed of services and components that implement those
        services.  The frontend components are depicted in the component UML

        relationships:

    <section name="Components">
      <p>
        Each component has a service interface which is defined within an 
        service provider interface (SPI) project which also includes supporting
        classes and interfaces like monitors, and configuration beans.  Each
        component also has a POJO implementation project and a one or more
        container specific projects wrapping the POJO implementation.  The
        source organization of a component is discussed in greater detail
