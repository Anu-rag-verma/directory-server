    <section name="X.500 Vs. LDAP Overview">
      <p>
        There really is not much to this for now.  LDAP is the focus although
        X.500 is not far behind.  Expect to find here those things describing 
        the differences between the two and how the server accomodates both
        protocols.

    <section name="LDAP Support">
      <p>
        The first release of the server will predominantly be for LDAP.  There
        may be X.500 hooks or features that are supported however the primary
        focus initially is LDAP.

      <p>
        As we add more X.500 directory modules and functionality we will grow
        this section.
