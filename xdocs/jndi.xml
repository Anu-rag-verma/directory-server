    <section name="Eve JNDI Provider">
      <p>
        Besides an LDAP protocol server, Eve is also a JNDI provider for the
        LDAP namespace.  Unlike the SUN JNDI LDAP Provider which is an LDAP
        client, the Eve JNDI Provider is not.  JNDI operations on Contexts
        directly tap into the server's database partitions to add, lookup,
        alter, and search for entries.  There is nothing done over the wire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eve leverages its JNDI LDAP provider in several ways.  First stored
        procedures written in Java will naturally use JNDI to alter entries
        using this provider.  Thanks to JNDI the same procedure outside of the
        server can be tested using the SUN JNDI LDAP provider.  This
        transparency is wicked cool making testing easy.  The Eve JNDI provider
        is also used as the API of choice for integrating Eve into other Java
        applications and servers.  The first InitialContext request to the Eve
        provider fires up the entire server.  So you need not learn anything
        new to start playing with her!
      </p>

      <p>
        This document describes the Eve JNDI Provider in terms of the custom
        properties used to control its behavoir in the solid state and for
        configuring her on start up.
