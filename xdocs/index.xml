      <p>Welcome to the Eve Directory Server Homepage!</p>

      <p>
        Eve is an embeddable LDAP server written in Java.  It has been designed
        to introduce triggers, stored procedures, queues and views to the world
        of LDAP which has lacked these rich constructs.

            thanks to Maven.  But this should go off on how the build is
            structured as well for developers.
