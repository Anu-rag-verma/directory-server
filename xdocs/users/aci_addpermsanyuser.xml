Add operations for regular entries (not subentries) are special in that only
perscriptive ACI are consulted when determining a requestors ability to add an
entry.  When the following ACIItem below is added as a perscriptiveACI attribute
value of a subentry, it allows any user to perform add operations within the
subtree specified by that
subentry:</p>
      <source>{ 
  identificationTag "allowAddByAnyUser", 
  precedence 14,
  authenticationLevel none,
  itemOrUserFirst userFirst: 
    { 
      userClasses { allUsers },
      userPermissions 
        { { 
            protectedItems {entry, allUserAttributeTypesAndValues},
            grantsAndDenials { grantAdd } 
        } }
    } 
}

          <p>
It has a unique identification tag so it can easily be retrieved by lookups
using substring expressions on the id
tag.</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection heading="h4" name="precedence">
          <p>
It has a precedence value which is used to determine the prevailing permission
when conflicting ACIItems are
present.</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection heading="h4" name="authenticationLevel">
          <p>
The authenticationLevel is the minimum authentication requirement for requestor
for the ACI to by applied:  According to
X.501:</p>
          <p>
... Strong authentication of the requestor is considered to exceed a requirement
for simple or no authentication, and simple authentication exceeds a requirement
for no authentication
